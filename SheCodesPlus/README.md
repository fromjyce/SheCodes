  8. Plus Week Two Summary

In Week 2 of the workshop, we continued to deepen our understanding of web development. The curriculum encompassed a range of critical topics, starting with debugging techniques to address missing files, ensuring our ability to troubleshoot effectively. We then dived into the world of visual design, exploring elements such as fonts and advanced CSS positioning to enhance the aesthetics of our web projects. Bootstrap was introduced as a powerful tool for responsive web design, and we also gained proficiency in creating user-friendly HTML forms for data input. The week culminated in the practical application of our skills, as we transformed our paper wireframes into functional HTML and CSS prototypes using VS Code or CodeSandbox. This hands-on experience solidified our grasp of web development fundamentals and marked a significant step in translating design concepts into interactive web realities. As part of [our homework](https://github.com/fromjyce/SheCodes/tree/main/SheCodesPlus/Week%20Two/Homework), we were tasked with converting our paper wireframes into HTML and CSS code and hosting them in a Vanilla Sandbox. This assignment not only reinforced our learning but also allowed us to apply our newfound skills to create a tangible web project. The Workshop Week 2 Summary encapsulates our journey through these valuable topics, equipping us with the knowledge and skills to craft compelling web experiences.
